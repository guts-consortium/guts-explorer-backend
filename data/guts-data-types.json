It can be used to determine beat-to-beat intervals (BBIs) for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, as well as to measure overall heart rate. Beat-to-beat interval (BBI) is the time between consecutive heartbeats, derived from heart rate recordings. It provides insights into heart rate variability (HRV), autonomic nervous system regulation, and physiological stress responses."
